# HOW TO INSTALL

The recommended way is to install it globally for the current user and make it available from PATH.

#### Using Curl

We will use the self installer script that will take care of all for us.

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/exadra37-bash/package-manager/raw/last-stable-release/self-install.sh | bash -s
```

#### Lets try it out

```bash
$ bpm --version

Bash Package Manager 0.2.0  by Exadra37
```

**NOTES:** this package must be always called from the root of your project.
